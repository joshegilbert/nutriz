# Project Setup Answers

* **Package manager?** npm (existing `package-lock.json` and scripts use npm).
* **Node version?** Node.js 18 or newer (tested with v18+; aligns with Vite/Vuetify requirements).
* **UI library?** Vuetify 3 with Vue 3 (already declared in dependencies).
* **Test runner?** None configured currently (no automated tests to keep iteration fast).
* **No new dependencies without approval?** Yes, prefer avoiding additional packages unless explicitly approved.
* **Repository host?** GitHub.
