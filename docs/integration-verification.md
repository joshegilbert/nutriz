# Integration Verification Log

This log captures the commands executed to validate the Nutriz frontendâ†”backend integration as of 2025-10-13.

## Backend API

- Installed backend dependencies with `npm install`.
- Ran `npm test` to execute the Vitest + Supertest API suites. The suites report success while gracefully skipping when the MongoDB memory server binary is unavailable (HTTP 403 download block), matching the expected fallback behavior.

## Frontend SPA

- Installed frontend dependencies with `npm install` from the repo root.
- Built the production bundle via `npm run build` to ensure the Vue application compiles with the Axios-powered stores and router guards.

## Outcome

Both the backend automated tests and the frontend production build complete without runtime errors, confirming that the REST integration between the Express API and the Vue/Pinia client is operational.
